# Contributions and feedback

Contributions are welcome via GitHub issues. Before opening an issue, please check
whether [a ticket already exists](../../issues) that describes your intention.

Since we only publish snapshots of the code until further notice, we cannot process pull requests.

The development of Public Beta is taking place within a tight timeframe. We do our best to respond to your feedback as
quickly as possible.

Thank you for your contribution
