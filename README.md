# Warning - This Version is work in progress and NOT PEN-TESTED

# SWIYU generic verifier service

This software is a web server implementing the technical standards as specified in
the [Swiss e-ID and trust infrastructure: Initial implementation](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/initial-technology/).
Together with the other generic components provided, this software forms a collection of APIs allowing issuance and
verification of verifiable credentials without the need of reimplementing the standards.

The generic verifier service provides in its management interface the possibility to initiate a verification process and
in the oid4vp interface the necessary tools to verify a verifiable presentation.

The management interface should be only accessible from inside the organization. Whereas the oid4vp interface needs to
be accessible by the wallet.

# Deployment

> Please make sure that you did the following before starting the deployment:
>
> - Generated the signing keys file with the didtoolbox.jar
> - Generated a DID which is registered on the identifier registry
> - Registered yourself on the swiyuprobeta portal
> - Registered yourself on the api self-service portal

## 1. Set the environment variables

A sample compose file for an entire setup of both components and a database can be found
in [sample.compose.yml](sample.compose.yml) file.
**Replace all placeholder <VARIABLE_NAME>**. In addition to that you need to adapt
the [verifier metadata](sample.compose.yml#L35) to your use case.
Those information will be provided to the holder on a dedicated endpoint serving as metadata information of your
verifier.

Please be aware that the **oid4vp** endpoints need to be publicly accessible and set in the environment variable
`EXTERNAL_URL`.

## 2. Creating a verification

> For a detailed understanding of the verification process and the data structure of verification please consult the
> [DIF presentation exchange specification](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/#presentation-definition).
> For more information on the general verification flow consult
> the [OpenID4VP specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-20.html)

Once the components are deployed you can create your first verification. For this you first need to define a
presentation
definition. Based on that definition you can then create a verification request for a holder as shown in the example
below.
In this case we're asking for a credential called "my-custom-vc" which should at least have the attributes
firstName and lastName. The following request can be performed by using the swagger endpoint on https://<EXTERNAL_URL of
verifier-agent-management>**/swagger-ui/index.html**

To see more details and examples of the verification process please consult the [documentation](documentation/verification_process.md).

# Development

> Please be aware that this section **focus on the development of the verifier service**. For the deployment of
> the component please consult [deployment section](#Deployment).

## Single service development

Run the following commands to start the service. This will also spin up a local postgres database from
the docker compose.yml:

```shell
./mvnw -f verifier-application  spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local # start spring boot java application
```

After the start api definitions can be found [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

### Updating Openapi Spec

The `openapi.yaml` can be updated by using the generate-doc profile.

```
mvn verify -P generate-doc
```

## Configuration

### Generate Keys

Currently only EC 256 keys are used.
Generate private key with:
`openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem`
Remember to keep private keys private and safe. It should never be transmitted, etc.

On the base registry the public key is published. To generate the public key form the private key we can use
`openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem`

### HSM - Hardware Security Module

For operations with an HSM, the keys need not be mounted directly into the environment running this application.
Instead, a connection is created to the HSM via JCA. This can be with
the [Sun PKCS11 provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/security/pkcs11-reference-guide1.html) or a vendor
specific option.
Note that for creating the keys it is expected that the public key is provided as self-signed certificate.

For vendor specific options it is necessary to provide the library in the java classpath. For this mount or add the necessary jars to the docker container.
Provide the environment variable `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH` to the directory which should be added to the classpath.

### Webhook Callbacks

For verifiers, it can be useful to receive a webhook callback from this service
instead of performing active polling to check if a verification has been done.
It is possible to configure a Webhook Callback endpoint, optionally secured by API Key. Please note that delivery of
callback events will be retried until successful, to guarantee an at-least-once delivery.
Failed deliveries will create error logs and be retried in the next interval.

| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |

| WEBHOOK_API_KEY_HEADER | (Optional) API key header, if the callback uri has a api key for protection. Will be used as HTTP header key.                                                                           |
| WEBHOOK_API_KEY_VALUE  | (Optional, Required if WEBHOOK_API_KEY_HEADER is set) The API key used.                                                                                                                 |
| WEBHOOK_INTERVAL       | How often the collected events are sent. Value interpreted as milliseconds if given a plain integer or an [ISO 8601 duration format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). | 

Callbacks will be sent on change of verification state. This means the verification can be fetched by the business
verifier.

Management Endpoints can be secured as OAuth2 Resource Server using Spring Security.

For more details see the official [spring security documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/index.html).

For easy playground setup security starts deactivated. It is activated when the appropriate environment variables are set.

## Usage

### Perform a verification

To perform a verification, it is required to first create the request. This is done with
the `POST /management/verifications`
endpoint.
What data is requested can be selected by adding in additional fields only containing "path".
Filters are currently only supported for `$.vct` - the Verifiable Credential Type.
In the following example we request to have the dateOfBirth revealed to us from a Credential with the type "test-sdjwt".

```json
{
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "name": "Example Verification",
    "purpose": "We want to test a new Verifier",
    "input_descriptors": [
        {
            "id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
            "name": "Example Data Request",
            "format": {
                "vc+sd-jwt": {
                    "sd-jwt_alg_values": [
                        "ES256"
                    ],
                    "kb-jwt_alg_values": [
                        "ES256"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "constraints": {
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "path": [
                            "$.vct"
                        ],
                        "filter": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "const": "test-sdjwt"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "path": [
                            "$.dateOfBirth"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The response of this post call contains the URI which has to be provided to the holder.

## Release Process and Versioning

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
This project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to make it easy to understand the impact of a software release just by looking at the version number. Our version numbers follow the format:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-rc][+BUILD]
```

### Version Components

#### MAJOR version (X.y.z)
- Incremented when we Contract the system by removing, changing, or breaking existing features
- Example: Removing a deprecated endpoint, changing response formats in a non-compatible way

#### MINOR version (x.Y.z)
- Incremented when we Extend the system with new, backward-compatible functionality
- Example: Adding a new endpoint, introducing an optional field, or extending valid inputs

#### PATCH version (x.y.Z)
- Incremented when we Maintain the system with backward-compatible security fixes on Release Branch
- Example: Security bug fixes or important performance optimizations needed on the last Release

### Release Candidates
Release Candidates (RCs) are tagged as prereleases to indicate a build that is a candidate for the next official release:

- Format: x.y.z-rc.N (e.g., 1.4.0-rc.1, 1.4.0-rc.2)
- Used for testing, validation, and final quality assurance
- Once validated, the RC suffix is dropped for the official release
- Example: 1.4.0-rc.1, 1.4.0-rc.2 → 1.4.0 (final release)

### Release Workflow
Our release process follows these principles:

Version Contract: If you upgrade within the same MAJOR version, your existing integrations will continue to work (following the Expand and Migrate Pattern)

GitHub Pre-release Tagging:
- All versions with -rc.N suffix (e.g., 2.1.0-rc.1) are published as GitHub Prereleases
- Prereleases are meant for testing, staging, and final validation
- After validation, we remove the -rc suffix and publish the official release (e.g., 2.1.0)
- Official releases are not marked as pre-releases on GitHub

## Missing Features and Known Issues

The swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure was deliberately released at an early stage to enable future ecosystem participants. The [feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/projects/1/views/7) shows the current discrepancies between Public Beta and the targeted productive Trust Infrastructure. There may still be minor bugs or security vulnerabilities in the test system. These are marked as [‘KnownIssues’](../../issues) in each repository.

## Contributions and feedback

The code for this repository is developed privately and will be released after each sprint. The published code can
therefore only be a snapshot of the current development and not a thoroughly tested version. However, we welcome any
feedback on the code regarding both the implementation and security aspects. Please follow the guidelines for
contributing found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
