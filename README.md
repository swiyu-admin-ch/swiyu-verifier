# Generic verification service OID4VP

This software is a web server implementing the technical standards as specified in
the [Swiss e-ID and trust infrastructure: Initial implementation](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/initial-technology/).
Together with the other generic components provided, this software forms a collection of APIs allowing issuance and
verification of verifiable credentials without the need of reimplementing the standards.

The Generic Verifier Validator Service is the public facing validator to handle validation with the wallet.

As with all the generic issuance & verification services it is expected that every issuer and verifier hosts their own
instance of the service.

The verification validator service is linked to the verification management services through a database, allowing to
scale every service independently of the management service.

# Deployment

For the deployment of the component please
consult [deployment section of the verifier-agent-management](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/eidch-verifier-agent-management)
because it is the main interaction point with the issuer managent/oid4vci bundle

# Development

> Please be aware that this section **focus on the development of the verifier oid4vp service**. For the deployment of the
> component please consult [deployment section of the verifier-agent-management](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/eidch-verifier-agent-management).

## Single service development
Run the following commands to start the service. This will also spin up a local postgres database from
docker-compose.yml:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local # start spring boot java application
```

After the start api definitions can be found [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/)

## Integrated service development
The integrated service development describes how to devolp this service together with its management component.  

The managment component needs to be started and be fully running before the oid4vp component can be started.  

Run the following commands to start this service.

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local,local-shared # start spring boot java application
```

After the start api definitions can be found [here](http://localhost:8003/swagger-ui/index.html).

## Configuration

### Generate Keys

Currently only EC 256 keys are used.
Generate private key with:
`openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem`
Remember to keep private keys private and safe. It should never be transmitted, etc.

On the base registry the public key is published. To generate the public key form the private key we can use
`openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem`

### HSM - Hardware Security Module

For operations with an HSM, the keys need not be mounted directly into the environment running this application.
Instead, a connection is created to the HSM via JCA. This can be with
the [Sun PKCS11 provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/security/pkcs11-reference-guide1.html) or a vendor
specific option.
Note that for creating the keys it is expected that the public key is provided as self-signed certificated.
