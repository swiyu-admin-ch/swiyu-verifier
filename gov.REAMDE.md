## Gov usage
### 1. Setup up infrastructure
When deployed in an RHOS setup the issuer-management / issuer-agent setup need the following setup
#### Database
Single postgresql databse service needs to be available. Make sure that the following bindings exist between your database and the application namespace:
- database -> issuer-verifier-management: Full
- database -> issuer-verifier-oid4vci: Read-Write
#### MAV
The MAV needs to be bound to the application namespace. Make sure the secrets are located in the path **default/application_secrets**
and you configured the vault so that it uses the application_secrets as properties
```yaml
vaultsecrets:
  vaultserver: https://my-vault-server.example.com
  serviceaccount: default
  cluster: xyz-cluster
  path: default
  properties:
    - application_secrets
``` 
### 2. Set the environment variables
Due to the separation of the secret and non-secret variables the location is split. Make sure that you've set at least the following variables.
Concerning the actual values take a look at the [sample.compose.yml](sample.compose.yml)

> **After this** continue with [creating an initial verification](README.md#2-creating-a-verification)
