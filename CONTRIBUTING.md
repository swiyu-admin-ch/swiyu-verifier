# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome via GitHub issues and GitHub pull requests. Before opening an issue or pull request, please check whether [a ticket already exists](../../issues) that describes your intention. Our [status board](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/projects/2) provides you with an overview of the status of your enquiry.

In order to submit bug-fixes and minor improvements to this repository, you will need to agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](developer-certificate-of-origin) (DCO). This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license.

**Every commit you make to our project must be signed off by you.** This can be done by adding a line to your commit message:

`Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.org>`

With this, you are certifying that you have the right to submit the work and that you are doing so under the project’s license. To make things easier, you can also set your git config `user.name` and `user.email` and then commit and sign-off using the -s git commit command.

`git commit -s`

**Use your real name (pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are not accepted).** 

The development of Public Beta is taking place within a tight timeframe. We do our best to respond to your feedback as
quickly as possible.

Thank you for your contribution
